Very simple rails app for the Swiss Rails usergroup to coexist with our meetup.com group.

## Getting started

### Configure environment

Create a configuration file for your local environment and configure `meetup_api_key` to use your own [Meetup API key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/)

```cp config/secrets.example.yml config/secrets.yml```

### Import from meetup

Once configured with your meetup API key you may import current meetups using

```rails r MeetupJob.new.perform```
