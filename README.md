Very simple rails app for the Swiss Rails usergroup to coexist with our meetup.com group.

## Getting started

### Configure the environment

Create a configuration file for your local environment and configure `meetup_api_key` to use your own [Meetup API key](https://secure.meetup.com/meetup_api/key/). Create your own secrets.yml file with.

`cp env.example .env`

Paste the Meetup API key in the .env file. The file should now look something like this:

```
MEETUP_API_KEY: 253116536670112a7855465923462b0a

```

### Install missing gems

Install the gems from the gemfile. Run

`bundle install`

or just `bundle` in the console to install the  gems for that project.

### Set up the database

To set up the database in the project run the command:

`rake db:setup`

in the console. This project runs on [postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org/) which you will need to install beforehead if you haven't.

### Import from meetup

Once configured with your meetup API and set up the database key you may import current meetups using

`rails r MeetupJob.new.perform`

### Troubleshooting

In case you changed the secrets.yml with your API key and the above command didn't work (for example it returns `unauthorized`), try restarting spring.

### Run the server

start the rails server with

`bundle exec rails server`

alternatively you can run `rails s` as a shorthand for it. The server runs on port 3000 by default so you can access the project by typing [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
